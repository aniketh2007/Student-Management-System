# Student-Management-System using Python and SQLite
I have attached the python program and sqlite.
 I hope it is useful for the user abt to use it.
 I have not attached the report.
 The user have to link the python program with the sqlite.
 The user can change the background colour like he wants he can even add the picture behind.
 The user can use images like he wants. 
 The user can choose which images he requires toexcute the images in to the program install pIL give command in your cmd"pip install pillow"
 The user Should place all the files together to run the program.
 The softwares required to run the program are:
 (i) Python
 (ii)Sqlite to install it give command in cmd"pip install db-sqlite3" 
 Better if use vs code to run this program.
